SQL:

DATA:
 
	Data is a raw fact which is discribe the properties offen NDT or Object.

NDT or OBJECT:
	
	Anything which is physical excest its refer to NDT 

DATA BASE:
	it is a platform or medeum where is stored data systamatic organized manner.

BASIC OPERATION OF DATABASE:
	Create read update delete.

DBMS:(Data base management syatem)
	Is a software to maintain and manage a Data base.
Features:
 Security and Athundecation.

Types of DBMS:
 Network DBMS
 Object orented DBMS
 Hirarical DBMS
 R DBMS

R DBMS:
	Is a type of DBMS. where we stored the data in the form of Table or relation.
	If DBMS Follows relational model is also called R DBMS.
	If DBMS follows EFCADD rule is also called R DBMS.
	We communicate with the R DBMS we use an language strucared Query language(SQL). 

EF CADD TOOL:
	A data must be single value data or atomic data. We can stored a data in multiple tables.
	 
	And also we can extablse connection any two tables by using Key attribute. 
	To validate the data we can assign data types and constrains.
	Data types are mantaory but the constarins or opptinal.
	
DATA TYPES:
	1. char(Fixed memory length)
	2. varchar
	3. Large object
	4. Date
	5. number

Type of data or kind of data which is used in memory location.
	CHAR which is used to store the character we can stored digits enclosed with single''.
Syntex:
	char(size); //(maximum 2000)

Varchar: It is used to store the char 
Syntex:
	varchar(size);
	In varchar unused memory is gives to the memory again. its called variable length memory location.
[Varchar2(size 4000)]

Large Object:
	1. char large object
	2. binary large object
1:
	it is used to store large amount of char. we can store upto 4GB.
Syntex:
	CLOB;
2:
	This datatype used to binary object such as audio file video file image PDF Etc.., in the form of binary format.
Syntex:
	BLOB;

DATE:(Store date)
		DD-MM-YYY(past/feature)
			YY( current)
		DD-MON-23
Constrains:
	
	1. Unique 
	2. NOTNULL
	3. check
	4. Primary key(commination of unique and NOTNULL)
	5. forgin key

UNIQUE: 
	Avoid duplicate value which are entered in to the cell.
NOTNULL:
	Is used to reprecent the cell should not be empty.
NULL:
	twhich is used to represent the Empty cell or Nothing .NULL does not Occupaid the memory.
	NULL = NULL (not same) Any opeator performed with NULL result end will be NULL.
CHECK:
	Syntex:
	Check(Condition);
		It is used to provide the Extra condition to a column
PRIMAEY KEY:
	A table can have only one primary key(Data base starnded)
	Primary key always combination of unique and NOTNULL.
	It is not manitory to have primary key in a table but disignwise differable.
	Referntial intigrity constarin
FOREGIN KEY:
	Is is used to extablse the connection of any 2 table.
	A Primary key of table is eligible for foregin key in Another table.
	Foregin key accect
	Also known as referential integrity constrains.
